## Project BlackJack

Project-BlackJack is an application that simulates physical cards and the interaction with them, thus creating the possibility to play card games without physical cards. It is designed to run on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, â€¦ etc) and to support many different card games. Currently, using our app you may play the following  card games: BlackJack, President, Poker, Hearts, I Doubt It, Crazy Eights, Spades, Rummy and perhaps many other games.

Imagine the situation where you meet with your friends and you would like to play a card game with them, but nobody brought the cards. Personal mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are a widespread technology during our daily lives and activities and almost everybody owns a mobile device. Immediately we got the idea to create a possibility to play card games using your mobile device, therefore we decided to code an app that simulates the interaction with physical cards as our final project in Mobile Computing.

However, today mobile devices are designed and have traditionally been utilized for individual use, not shared or collaborative. Since playing card games involves people to be together at the same location and being collaborative, the realisation of this project is predetermined to be a co-located and collaborative app.
